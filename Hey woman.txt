Hey woman,
Don't let them close your mouth
Against your will.

That mouth
It's for singing
And laughing
And moving mountains
And screaming
When it hurts.

It's for kissing -
Don't let them shame you
Into loneliness.

It's for eating -
Don't let them shame you
Into starvation.

And above all

Don't you dare let them shame you
Into silence.
